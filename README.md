<p>Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an junior indie full-stack developer looking to participate in new challenges! All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I'm currently working on my passion game, "Anima-L", and finishing my Oracle Java Certificate. Right now, im learning about Godot 3/4 and Python, as I have an interest in AI and Cloud Computing.</p>
